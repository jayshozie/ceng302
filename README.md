## Directory Structure
**Languages Used:** SQL

- **[/lecture-notes](./lecture-notes):** These are my lecture notes compiled
from the stuff the instructor said during lecture hours, the slides provided by
the instructor, and stuff that I've added. They're written in Github Flavored
Markdown syntax, so I highly recommend you to view them on Github. You can
follow the course from these, they don't miss anything that is in the slides.
Actually, you'll probably learn more because I add stuff that are not available
on the slides but more than essential for the course.

- **[/exercises](./exercises):** These are <!-- LANG --> exercises and examples
that I've either come up myself or found on the internet. Each of them have its
own solution in [/exercises/solutions](./exercises/solutions). I recommend you
to try and solve them, and then check the solution.

- **[/assignments](./assignments):** These are in-class assignments that I was
given in the course. They're meant to be solved in-class with notes and books
open. I will try to upload these as accurate as I can, considering I may lose
access to the VPL after the assignment hour and I'm not good at memorization.

- **[/slides](./slides):** These are the slides given by the instructor.
